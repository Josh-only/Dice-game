## **🎮 How the Game Works**

* Each dice image represents a random number between **1 and 6**.
* On page load, both dice generate new values.
* The game compares both values:

  * **Player 1 wins** if their dice has the higher number.
  * **Player 2 wins** if theirs is higher.
  * **Draw** if both values match.
